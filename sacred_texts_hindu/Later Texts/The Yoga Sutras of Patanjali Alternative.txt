Text [Zipped]
...there is no cure for the misery of longing, but to fix the heart upon the eternal. (II, 17)
This is an early 20th century translation of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,
one of the earliest and most important texts of Yoga.
The translation and commentary are intended for general readers, so there
is a minimum of technical language and apparatus.
