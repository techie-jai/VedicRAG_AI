Text [Zipped]
This is a selection of translations from the 'minor' Upanishads.
These are texts which have been incorporated into the list of 108
Upanishads, principally dealing with Yogic philosophy and practices.
They describe some very esoteric concepts, and enumerate Hindu
technical terminology in great detail.
