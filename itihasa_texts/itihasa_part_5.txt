This is the eternal Shruti we have heard. The penances of men who were so noble, of men whose conduct and acts were so difficult of observance and accomplishment, of men those wishes were crowned with success on account of the strict satisfaction of their duties, became potent instruments for the destruction of all worldly desires. The Brahmanas hold that that Good conduct, which is wonderful, whose origin may be traced to very old times, which is eternal, and whose marks are unchangeable, which differs from the practices which even the good follow in time of distress and represents their acts in other situations, which is at one with carefulness, over which lust, anger, and other evil passions have no control, and on account of which there was no transgression in all mankind, subsequently became divided into four sub-divisions, agreeing with the four modes of life, by person unable to follow its duties in ininute detail and entirety.

O king, with sharpened arrows which were shot from a beautiful bow, he cut down Arjuna's one thousand arms each of which was like a massive iron bolt (for barring the door).

Rama, the descendant of the Bhrigu's race, came back to the hermitage with fuels for religious rites. The hero saw his father who had been killed. Being exceedingly grieved, he lamented for the sad fate that had befallen his father.
Vaishampayana said “Having said to that foremost of all wielders of weapons, viz., that delighter of all the Yadavas, got on his excellent car, well furnished with all sorts of powerful weapons.
Two pairs of best horses of the Kamvoja breed were yoked to that car and they were adorned with garlands of gold. The Dhur of that best of cars was of the colour of the morning sun.
On the right was yoked and horse known as Shaivya; on the left was placed Sugriva; the who Parshni was drawn by two others called Meghapushpa and Valahaka.
There was on that car celestial standard adorned with gems and gold and made by the celestial Architect, and standing high like the Maya of Vishnu.
Upon that standard was Vinata's son, Garuda, that enemy of snakes perched on the standard-top of of Keshava is the embodiment of truth.
The Hrishikesha, that foremost of all bowmen, got upon that car. After him Arjuna of irresistible deeds and Yudhishthira the king of the Kurus, got upon the same car,
Seated on that car. by the side of that Dasharha's hero, who held the bow called Sharnga, the two sons of Pandu shone highly beautiful, like the two Ashvins seated by the side of Vasava.
Making them got on that car of his which was adored by all the world, the Dasharha hero urged those best of fleet horses.
Those horses then suddenly ran taking after them that excellent vehicle ridden by the two sons of Pandu and by that foremost of Yadu's race.
Greatly quick-coursing, as those animals, were, bore away the wilder of Sharnga, a loud noise was caused by their motion, like that of birds passing through the air.
Running very quickly, they soon met, O foremost of Bharata's race, the mighty bowman Bhimasena in whose wake they had followed.
Although those great car-warriors met Bhima, they could not stop that son of Kunti, for filled with anger, he proceeded fiercely towards the enemy.
Before the very presence of those illustrious and firm bowmen, Bhima, by means of his very quick-coursing horses, proceeded towards the bank of the river Bhagirathi.
he saw the great and illustrious and darkcomplexioned and island-born Vyasa sitting near the edge of the water encircled by many Rishis.
And he also saw Drona's wicked son sitting by them, covered with dust, clad in a piece of cloth made of Kusha grass, and smeared all over with clarified butter.
Taking up his bow with arrows on it, the mighty-armed Bhimasena, the son of Kunti, rushed towards Ashvatthaman, and said, 'Wait, wait!'
Seeing that terrible bowman coming towards him bow in hand, and his tow brothers on Janarddana's car, Drona's son became exceedingly anxious and thought his end was night. Never to be depressed, he thought of that high weapon which he had obtained form his father.
He then took up a blade of grass with his left hand. Overcome with misfortune, he inspired that blade of grass with proper mantras and converted it into that powerful celestial weapon.
Unable to bear the arrows of the Pandavas and the presence of those wielders of celestial weapons, he cried in anger saying,-For the destruction of the Pandavas.'
Having said these words, O foremost of kings, the brave son of Drona discharged that weapon for stupefying all the worlds.
A fire then was begotten of that blade of grass, which appeared capable of destroying the three worlds like the all-destroying Yama at the end of the cycle.

Sanskrit Shloka: कुरुभियुध्यते सार्ध सर्वेश्चक्रगदाधरः। आह कुन्ती नूनमार्या पापमद्य निदर्शनम्॥ द्रौपदी च सुभद्रा च पश्यन्त्यौ सह बन्धुभिः। स भीम त्वरया युक्तो याहि यत्र धनंजयः॥
English Translation: The houses of good men can never be in want of grass, space, water and sweet words, the fourth. Bed to the tired, seat to one who is fatigued by standing, water to on who is thirsty and food to one who is hungry should be always given.
Pleasant looks, cheerful heart and sweet words are due to a guest. Rising up, the host should advance towards the guest; he should offer him a seat and duly worship him. This is the eternal Dharma. They who do not perform Agnihotra, they who do not wait upon bulls and cherish their kinsmen, guest, friends, sons, wives and servants, for such negligence are consumed with sin. None should cook his food for himself, none should kill any animal for nothing. Non should eat that food which is not duly dedicated.
By scattering morning and evening food on the earth for dogs, Chandalas and birds, a person should perform the Vishvadeva (sacrifice).
He who eats Vighasa eats ambrosia. That, which remains after dedication in a sacrifice, is (also) regarded as ambrosia.
The pleasant looks (one casts on his guests), the attention he devotes to him, the sweet words with which he addresses him, the respect with which he follows him and the food and drink with which he treats him, are the five Dakshinas in that sacrifice.
He, who gives food freely to a fatigued way. farer, whom he has never seen before, obtains grcat virtuous merit.
He, who leading domestic life, follows such practices, obtains, it is said, great religious merit. O Brahmana, what is your opinion?
Shaunaka said: Alas, alas this worlds is full of contradictions! That which makes the good and the honest ashamed gratifies the wicked.
Move by ignorance and passions and becoming slaves to their senses, ignorant men perform many acts to gratify their stomachs an sexual organs.
Men are lcd astray by their seducing senses, as a charioteer who has lost his senses (is led। astray) by wicked horses.
When any of the six senses finds its ! particular object, the desire springs up in the heart to enjoy that particular object.
Thus when one's mind proceeds to enjoy the objects of any particular sense, a wish is entertained; that wish in its turn gives birth to a resolve.
As an insect falls into a flame from love of light, man falls into the fire of temptation, as it were pierced by the arrows of the objects of enjoyments) which are discharged by the desire which is the seed of resolve.
Blinded by sensual pleasure which he freely seeks and steeped in dark ignorance and folly which he mistakes for happiness, he thenceforth knows not himself. Like a wheel that is incessantly whirling, every creature, from ignorance, acts and desire, roves in various states in the world, wandering from one birth to another, ranging from Brahma to a blade of grass, an taking birth again and again now in water, now in earth and now in the sky.
This is the career of those that are without knowledge. Listen to that of the wise, the men who are intent on virtue and who are desirous of Moksha (emancipation).
This is the word of the Vedas, act, but act with renunciation. Therefore you should act renouncing Abhimana.
Performances of sacrifices, study, gifts, penance, truth, forgiveness, subduing the senses and renunciation of desire, these are the eight Dharmas declared by the Smriti.
Of these the first four pave the way to the regions of Pitris. Therefore it is the duty of all to act by renouncing Abhimana.
The last four are always observed by the pious who aspire to attain to the region of the celestials. The men of pure soul should observe these eight (paths).
Those, who wish to subdue the world for the purposes of salvation, should always act by fully renouncing all motives and by subduing their senses, rigidly observing vows, devotedly serving their preceptors, austerely regulating their food, diligently studying the Vedas, renouncing action as mean and restraining their heart. By renouncing desire and aversions, the celestials have obtained prosperity.
It is for the virtue of their wealth of Yoga, that the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Adityas, the Vasus and the Ashvins support all these creatures (of the world).
O son of Kunti, O descendant of Bharata, therefore you too like them, entirely renouncing actions with motive, try to obtain success in Yoga and austerities.
You have already obtained success as far as your debts to the Pitris, both male and female are concerned and you have obtained that success also which is derived from action. Try now to obtain success in from action. Try now to obtain success in penances in order to support the Brahmanas.
Those that are crowned with ascetic success can by virtue of that success do whatever they like. Therefore practising asceticism, realise all your wishes.
You best of beings, I shall now declare to you accurately what (the quality of) Darkness is. You highly blessed ones, do you understand what those qualities are that belong to Darkness.
Injuring (others), beauty, toil, pleasure and pain, cold and heat, lordship (or power), war, peace, argument, dissatisfaction, endurance, power, valour, pride, anger, exertion, quarrel (or collision), jealousy, desire, malice, battle, the sense of mineness, protection (of others), destruction fetters and affliction, buying and selling, lopping off, cutting, piercing, and cutting off the coat of mail that another has worn, fierceness, cruelty, vilifying, pointing out the faults of others, thoughts entirely devoted to worldly affairs, anxiety, animosity, vilification of others, false speech, false or vain gifts, hesitancy and doubt, boastfulness of speech dispraise and praise, laudation, prowess, defiance, attendance, obedience, servicc or ministrations, harbouring of thirst or desire, cleverness or dexterity of conduct, policy, carelessness, contumely, possessions, and various decorations which prevail in the world among men, women, animals, inanimate things, bouses, gricf, incredulousness, Vows and regulations, actions with expectation (of good results) various acts of public charity, the rites of Svaha salutations, rites of Svadha and Vashat, officiating at the sacrifices of others, imparting of instruction, performance of sacrifices, study, making of gifts, acceptance of giſts, riles of expiation, auspicious acts, the wish to have this and that, affection caused by the merits of the object for which or whom it is felt, treachery deception, disrespect and respect, theft, killing, desire of concealment, vexation, wakefulness, ostentation, pride, attachment, devotion, contentment, exultation, gambling, indulgence in scandal, all relations arising out of women, attachment to dancing, instrumental music, and songs, all these qualities, you learned Brahmanas, have been said to belong to Rajas or Darkness.
These men on Earth who meditate on the past, present, and the future, who are devoted to the threefold objects of life, viz., Religion, Profit, and Pleasure, who, acting from the impulse of desire, exult on acquiring riches in respect of every desire, are said to be covered by Darkness. These men have downward courses.
Repeatedly reborn in this world, they addict theinselves to pleasure. They covet what belongs to this world as also all those fruits of the world to come. They make gifts, accept gifts, offer oblations to the departed manes, and pour libations on the sacrificial fire.
The qualities of Darkness have (thus) been declared to you in their manifold aspects. The course of conduct also to which it leads has been properly described to you. The man who always understands these qualities, succeeds in always liberating himself from all of them which belong to Darkness.
The Brahmana said There are three enemies in the world. They are said to be minefield, according to their qualities. Exultation, satisfaction, and joy, these three qualities belong to Goodness.
Cupidity, anger and hatred, these three qualitics said to belong Darkness. Lassitude, procrastination and delusion, these three qualities belong to Ignorance.
Cutting these with showers of arrows, the intelligent man, free from idleness possessed of a tranquil soul, and with his senses under control, ventures to defeat others.
About it, persons conversant with ancient cycles recite some verses which were sung formerly by king Ambarisha who had acquired a tranquil soul.
When various kinds of faults were reigning supreme and when the righteous were afflicted, the illustrious Ambarisha put forth his strength for assuming sovereignty.
Subduing his own faults and adoring the righteous, he acquired great success and sang these verses.
I have controlled many faults. I have slain all enemies. But there is one, the greatest, vice which deserves to be destroyed but which has not been destroyed be me.
Urged by that fault, this individual soul fails to attain to freedom from desire. Possessed by desire, one runs into ditches without knowing it.
Urged by that fault, one induigcs in forbidden deeds. Do you cut off, cut off, that cupidity with sharp-edged swords.
From cupidity originates desire. From desire originates anxiety. The man who yields to desire acquires many qualities which bclong 10 Darkness,
When these have been acquired, he gets many qualities which belong to ignorance. On account of the qualities, he repeatedly takes birth, with the fetters of body united, and is moved to action. Upon the expiration of life, with body becoming separated and scattered, he once mects with death which is due to birth itself.
Hence, duly understanding this, and governing cupidity by intelligence, one should desire for sovereignty in his soul. This is (true) sovereignty. There is no other sovereignty here. The soul properly understood, is the king.
Even these were thc verses sung by the illustrious king Ambarisha, on the subject of sovereignty which he kept before him, that king who had severed the one foremost fault, viz.. cupidity.
Krishna said: O king, when Pradyumna (wounded by the arrows) became very much disheartened and aggrieved, the Vrishnis and the Andhakas began to exclaim, “Oh” and “Alas. The enemies (Shalva's men) became exceedingiy joyful.

English Translation: If a pure souled man wishes to go to the Pushkara even in his imagination, he is cleansed of all his sins and he rejoices in heaven.
Dhritarashtra said O Sanat-Sujata, what you have been saying regarding the attainment of emancipation and the origin of the universe is the best (discourse I have heard). Speak to me such words, (treating of subjects) rarely to be attained by men of desire, O you who have observed celibacy!
Sanat-Sujata said This supreme soul regarding which you ask me with such exaltation cannot be attained by him who is in a hurry. When the mind (desire) has been lost in the intellect (i.e. when intellect has gained a control over desire), the mind of man becomes indifferent to worldly things and this state is attainable only by asceticism.
Dhritarashtra said The true knowledge, that you are speaking of attainable by hard asceticism, is unborn in the mind and needs not any efforts for its manifestation and is manifested during the seeking of Brahma. How then can that immortality which is connected with a knowledge of the Supreme soul be obtained?
Sanat-Sujata said This true knowledge that is unborn is said to be undeveloped and is developed by asceticism. On obtaining the true knowledge, men leave this world. True knowledge is ever present in the old and eminent preceptors.
Dhritarashtra said That knowledge is capable of being gained by asceticism without difficulty. What sort of asceticism must be that? O Brahma, speak to me that.
Sanat-Sujata said Those who having entered into the dwelling of a preceptor and residing therein serve them and practice asceticism become Brahma himself, as it were; and casting off their bodies are united with Him.
Those who are in this world desirous of obtaining emancipation, subdue their desires. Those virtuous men get their souls separated from their body like a blade of grass from a marshy plot of ground.
The father and the mother, O Bharata, these two create the body; but the state gained from the instructions of the preceptor is sacred, free from death and without old age.
He (the preceptor) who discoursing on the Supreme Soul frees a man from untruth and distributes nectar should be regarded as father and mother. No injury should ever be done to him, knowing what he does.
A disciple should every day pay due respects to his preceptor and engage himself in study with a pure mind and concentrated attention. He should not be annoyed (at the humble and menial services he is called upon to perform) and not feel wrathful. This is the first step of asceticism.
He who gains knowledge (of his duties) by observing the duties of other disciples is said to observe the first step of the vow of asceticism.
What is agreeable to a preceptor should be done at the expense of life and wealth, by the mind, by actions or by speech. Doing this is said to be the second step.
A similar behaviour like that towards a preceptor should be adopted towards the preceptor's woke and the same should be done to his son. Doing this is said to be the second step.
Fully, appreciating what has been done to one's self by his preceptor and knowing the object thereof, a disciple should with exaltation in his heart think-I have been developed by him. This is the third step of asceticism.
A wise man should not remove himself (from the preceptor's abode) without requesting the preceptor; nor should he even speak or think “I do this” (i.e. I make this gift). This is the fourth step of asceticism.
A man obtains the object of the first step of asceticism by the aid of time (i.e. in due course), the second step by contact with the preceptor, the third by the energy of his own intellect and the next by discussion with others.
The effects of the practice of asceticism, which is made up of twelve constituent elements including righteousness and the effects of Angas and Balam (particular forms of asceticism) are said to be obtained by contact with the preceptor and by an earnest desire to know the Supreme Soul.
While in the position of a disciple, whatever wealth is earned should be given to the preceptor. It is by this means that he (the preceptor) earns his honest livelihood graced with many virtues. Such should also be the conduct of the preceptor's son.
With this rule of life one prospers in every way and obtains many sons and fame; to such a man, wealth is poured from all sides and to that place many people come for practicing asceticism.
By means of such asceticism, the gods attained their divine character and the wise Rishis of heavenly qualities attained to the regions of Brahma.
By this also did the beauty of the Gandharvas and Apsaras spring up; by such asceticism does the sun rise to make the day.
on These (i.e. Gandharvas, etc.) completion of their asceticism by this means attained to the state of the seekers of the Rasabheda (a fabulous gem supposed to grant every desire of the possessor) through the obtainment of the object of their desire.
He, who attached to austerities has recourse to asceticism and thereby purifies his body, comes to the condition of a child (free from passions, etc., characteristic of the old men) and that learned man in the end conquers death.
By pure work men obtain the perishable worlds, O Kshatriya-but that learned man, by means of his knowledge, obtains emancipation. There is no other path to emancipation.
Dhritarashtra said Of what form is the Supreme Soul, which is immortal and omnipresent and which the learned man sees in this world. Does he shine as white, red, black, blue or purple?
Sanat-Sujata said (The Supreme Soul) may appear as white, red, black, brown or like the sun; but its like is not to be met with in the earth, the sky, nor in the water of the sea.
It cannot be found among the stars, nor is it shut up in the lightning and its form cannot be seen among the clouds, nor in the air, nor among the gods, nor in the moon, nor in the sun,
Nor in the Rich, nor in the Yajush, nor in the Atharva, nor in the sacred Sama (Vedas). It is certain, O king, that it cannot be seen in the Rathantara, nor in the Barhadrath, nor in the great vows.
Incapable of being reached by our ignorance, even the king of Death, at the time of his end, is lost in it. Its form cannot be gazed at; it is like the edge of a razor and its form is like that of a high mountain.
It is the foundation of everything; it is nectar; it is the universe; it is vast and delightful. From it are born all creatures and there do they come to their end.
Having no duality, it is manifest in the form of the universe. Poets speak of it as having no change but in the language and form used for its description. That on which all this world stands-those who know this become immortal.
Bhishma said When they had passed away, I awoke. O Bharata; I was filled with great joy as I thought of the dream.
Then begin that mighty battle between him and me, O Bharata, which was wonderful and which made the hairs of all creatures stand on end.
Then Bhargava rained on me a shower of arrows, which I baffled by a (like) shower of arrows, O Bharata.
Thereupon he, of great asceticism, was greatly incensed and remembering what had happened the day before, he hurled, with anger, a dart at me,
Which was as hard as Indra's thunderbolt, was equal in effulgence, to the mace of Yama, (god of death) blazing like a flaming fire and licking as it were with its tongue, all quarters of the battle-field.
Then, O best among Kurus, it struck me on my shoulder, even then, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, like a lightning ranging in the sky.
Thus wondered by Rama, O red-eyed one of mighty arms, blood flowed freely like streams of red earth from a mountain.
Greatly incensed , I darted, at the son of Jamadagni, a deadly shaft, comparable to the poison of a serpent only.
That hero, the best of the twice-born, struck by it on the forehead, shone beautiful as a mountain with its peak.
Filled with great wrath he turned round, and drawing his bow with great strength aimed at me a terrible shaft, resembling death himself and capable of grinding all enemies.
That fierce shaft struck me on the breast hissing (through the air) like a serpent, and I fell down to the earth, O king, covered with blood.
Regaining my consciousness, I hurled at that intelligent son of Jamadagni a dart, bright and blazing as the lighting flesh.
That dart fell on the chest of that best of Brahmanas. And, O king, having fainted (from pain) he began to tremble all over.
Then his friend, that twice-born and great ascetic named Akritavrana, embraced him again and again and soothed him with words of auspicious import.
Thus comforted, Rama was filled with anger and vindictiveness, and that keeper of all observances brought forth a mighty weapon of Brahma.
Then, for the purpose of baffling also, I aimed the same excellent weapon of Brahma, which blazed forth, appearing like what happens at the end of the Yuga (at the final destruction).
Then those two Brahmic weapons met each other in mid-air, without being able to reach either Rama or myself, 0 best of Bharata's race.
Thereupon, in mid-welkin, only a flame blazed forth, and 0 lord of earth, all creatures becomes greatly afflicted,
The Rishis, and the gods together with the Gandharvas, 0 Bharata, became greatly afflicted, struck by the blazing effulgence.
Then the earth, with the mountains, forests and trees, began to tremble, and all creatures, becoming heated, became highly afflicted.
The firmament, О king, began to burn the ten points of the compass were filled with smoke. At that moment, those creatures that range the sky could not stay there.
While during this time all creatures, with the gods, the Asuras and Rakshasas began uttering exclamations of woe, O Bharata, “This is the time,” thought I and become desirous of shooting,
That weapon Prasvapa speedily, according to the words of command of the speakers of Brahma. And the Mantras also for using that weapon suddenly came to my mind.
Vaishampayana said : O descendant of Bharata, when the king thus addressed the sons of Pandu, the wickedminded Duryodhana became exceedingly happy. O best of the Bharata race, he summoned in private, Purochana and taking up his right hand, he thus spoke to that counsellor. O Purochana, this world, full of wealth, is mine. It is equally yours with me. (Therefore), you should protect it. I have no other more trustworthy supporter and counsellor than you with whom I can consult.
O sire, keep my counsel (a secret) and destroy my enemy by some clever device. Accomplish, what I ask you to do.
The Pandavas have been sent by Dhritarashtra to Varanavata. They will sport there in the festival at the command of Dhritarashtra.
Do that by with you can reach Varanavata this very day on a car drawn by swift asses.
Going there, erect a quadrangle palace at the outskirts of the city, (which should be) rich in materials and furniture. Guard it (also) well.
Use in it (in erecting that house,) hemp, resin and all other inflammable materials that are procurable.
Mixing a little earth with ghee, oil, fat and a large quantity of lac, plaster the wall with it.
Place carefully all over that house hemp, oil, ghee, lac and wood. In such a way that the Pandavas and other men may not even with scrutiny see them or conclude that it is made of inflammable materials. Erecting such a house and worshipping the Pandavas with great reverence, make them live in it with Kunti and all their friends.
Place there for the Pandavas seats, conveyances and beds of best workmanship, as ordered my father. Manage all this in a way so that none in the city of Varanavata may know it, till the end we have in view is accomplished.
Knowing that they are sleeping in that house in confidence and without fear, set fire to it, beginning from the gate.
The people will think that they have been burnt to death in that burning house; and therefore none will be able to blame us for the death of the Pandavas,
Purochana promised to that Kaurava (Duryodhana) to carry out all by saying, “Be it so and he then went (away) on a swift car drawn by asses.
