# 🕉️ Ancient Vedic Wisdom AI: The RAG System

Welcome to the Vedic Wisdom AI project! This repository hosts the codebase for an advanced RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) artificial intelligence system deeply rooted in ancient Indian knowledge, granthas, andepics.

The core aim of this system is to bridge the gap between profound ancient philosophy and modernday challenges. By conversingwith this AI, users can seek guidance through the lowest and toughest points in their lives, find strategic insights on leadership and "building an empire," or simply explore the ethical and spiritual tenets of Dharma—all grounded entirely in the authentic verses of the original texts.

## 📖 The Vision

For thousands of years, the answers to the complexities of human life, morality, conflict, and governance have been preserved in ancient Sanskrit literature. This project aims to democratize that knowledge.

Whether you are:

- A student seeking clarity and focus
 A leader or entrepreneur looking for strategic wisdom (akin to the strategicdiplomacy of the Mahabharata)
- An individual navigating personal grief or moral dilemmas

This AI acts as a philosophical companion, querying thousands of ancient verses to provide contextual, translated, and highly relevant guidance.

## 🗄️ The Dataset: Rooted in the Itihāsa Corpus

This system is initially trained and embedded using the Itihāsa dataset, a monumental corpus detailed in the 2021 research paper: "Itihāsa: A large-scale corpus for Sanskrit to English translation".

### Current Dataset Highlights:

,+ Translation Pairs: A massive collection of Sanskrit shlokas mapped to their English translations
The Ramayana: Contains 1, translation pairs extracted from 642 chapters, focusing on the life, ethics, and ideals of Lord Rama
The Mahabharata: Contains ,10 translation pairs extracted from 2,10 chapters, encompassing complex politics, war, duty, and the ultimate teachings of life
ve coerage

Note: As noted in th foundationalresearh, Sanskrit is highly agglutinative and morpholgically rich. By leeraging this rigorously alignd dataset, ou RAG system cn accurately retrieve the exact shlokas that match the semantic intent of a user's Enlish qury.
## 🧠 How It Works (The RAG Architecture)

Knowledge Ingestion: The English translations and their corresonding Sanskit shlka from the datae ae processed and stored in strctr te
Contextual Retrieval: When a user asks a question (e.g., "How do I find courage when I have lost everything?"), the system seaches thrh the verses for temos relevant teachings from te epic
Augmented Generation: e e sents the retrieved shlokas ith pope ontext, cats and inepetatis the erse

## 🚀 Features

Authentic Citations: Every piece of advice provided by the AI is backed by a specific quoted shloka (in Sanskrit/Devanagari) along with its English translation
Context-Aware Guidance: Capable of mapping abstract ancient concepts (like Karma, Dharma, and Niti) to modern psychological and strategic scenarios
