The Veda, I feel convinced, will occupy scholars for centuries to come, and will take and maintain for ever its position as the most ancient of books in the library of mankind.--F. Max Müller, p. xxxi
VI, 58, 3. yas te pûshan navah antáh samudré hiranyáyîh antárikshe káranti.
Thy golden ships, O Pûshan, which move within the watery sky.--p. 61
This is one of the pinnacles of
19th century western Vedic scholarship.
It is one of the three volumes in the
Sacred Books of the East
which Max Müller, the series editor, was the sole author of.
Müller focuses here on four dozen hymns in the Rigvedas
to the 'Storm Gods:' the Maruts.
Distant relations of Mars, Thor, and Ares, the Maruts are
Vedic-era deities associated with lightning, thunder, and the heavens.
If you excerpted just the translations, this would amount to about sixty pages.
The full book weighs in at 550 pages.
The true value of this work is Müller's deep analysis
of the mythological, linguistic and poetic background of the hymns.
The index, which gives every root form of every word in the text,
is practically a skeleton key to Vedic Sanskrit.
PRODUCTION NOTES: This book took nearly two months of
focused work to transcribe, and
a total of four proof passes, as conventional OCR technology is unable
to handle many of the aspects of this book at this point in time.
Unicode implementations and
web browsers are only
now catching up with the typography used here.
My goal was to reproduce the book in its entirety with all of the
metrical markup in place.
Only in one case did I have to compromise: the start of elision is indicated
by a Unicode combining double inverted breve (0x361); but the
end of the overbarred section is indicated by a green asterisk, e.g.
hă͡rĭ*bhīr (p. ciii).
