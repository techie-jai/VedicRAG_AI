Text [Zipped]
Part I (SBE32)   |
Part II (SBE46)
This is the second volume in the 'Vedic Hymns' section
of the Sacred Books of the East.
It was the final SBE text volume to be converted to etext.
While continuing the thread of Vedic linguistics which
Max Müller started in the first Vedic Hymns volume of the SBE,
Oldenberg does not attempt to rise to the same level of analysis
of the religious content of these Rig-veda hymns.
In fact, at several points he states that he really has no
idea what some passages in these hymns mean,
simply attempting the best possible translation.
For instance, there are repeated references to the
'Two Mothers' of Agni, which appears to refer to
a pre-Vedic twin mother goddess.
However Oldenberg makes no attempt to explain this beyond
identifying the two as Dawn and Night.
It would be of some interest to find out the source of this myth.
