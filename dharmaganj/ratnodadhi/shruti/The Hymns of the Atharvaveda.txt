Text [Zipped]
This is the Ralph T.H. Griffith translation of the Atharvaveda.
The Atharvaveda is a Vedic-era collection of spells, prayers,
charms, and hymns. There are prayers to protect crops from lightning
and drought, charms against venomous serpents, love spells,
healing spells, hundreds of verses, some derived from the Rig veda,
all very ancient.
This is the first time a complete translation of the Atharvaveda
has been posted on the Internet.
The Maurice Bloomfield partial translation, previously at this location, has
been moved to the sbe42 directory.
