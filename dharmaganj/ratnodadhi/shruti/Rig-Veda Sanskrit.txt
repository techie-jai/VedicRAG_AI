The Rig Veda
in Sanskrit
This is an experimental Sanskrit version of the Rig Veda; each verse
occupies a separate file and
is encoded in UTF-8 Unicode Devanagari and standard romanization.
This version is derived from an ITRANS transcription which has
been published at several different locations on the Internet.
This version has some minor defects originating in the source files,
which we hope to fix at some point.
These files were posted in June 2004, and have not as of yet been
vetted by any Sanskrit scholars.
We welcome feedback about these files,
see the site contact page.
Also refer to the notes on the ITRANS source.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
To view the Sanskrit and Romanization of the Rig Veda,
you need to set up your browser to view Unicode content.
If you don't do this,
you will see lots of boxes or question marks on these pages.
This is not a problem with the site, it is a problem with your browser.
