Text [Zipped]
This little self-published work could be most charitably described
as an anthology of material on Kundalini Yoga.
Very little of this book was actually written by Gherwal; the
majority of the material here consists of long quotes from other
authors, notably Arthur Avalon.
On page VII, Gherwal states that the book was published in just
three weeks, and it shows in the number of errata
and glitches.
The reason why this book is of interest is the English
translation of the Lalita Sahasranama,
the 'Thousand Names' of the Goddess.
Whether this is also an appropriation by Gherwal, or original
work is unknown, but I was unable to find any other public domain
English translation of this piece, which is well-known in India.
Gherwal also authored
Yoga Vashisht, or Heaven Found.
