Text [Zipped]
It is truth which makes the earth bear all beings, truth which makes the sun rise. It is through truth that winds blow, and that the waters flow.--p. 93
This is a translation of the Hindu law books written about the
sixth century CE by Narada and Brihaspati.
These are later works than the other legal writings
in the Sacred Books of the East
series, such as The Laws of Manu (SBE25),
The Institutes of Vishnu (SBE07),
Sacred Laws of the Aryas, Part I (SBE02),
and Sacred Laws of the Aryas, Part II (SBE14),
all composed prior to 200 BCE at the latest.
According to Jolly, the courtroom procedure discussed here is very
similar to that described in the earliest known Hindu drama,
The Little Clay Cart.
