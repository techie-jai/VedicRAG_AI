Text [Zipped]
This is a short collection of translations of Southern Indian devotional
poetry by worshippers of the god Shiva, along with commentary, written by
sympathetic Europeans.
These poems, as often happens, have been integrated into
popular litergy and culture.
This will make interesting reading for anyone looking for information
about Tamil literature or southern Indian vernacular Hindu
traditions.--J.B. Hare, Feb. 3rd, 2010.
