Possibly the oldest extant text about Hatha Yoga,
The Hatha Yoga Pradipika
was written about the 15th century CE, by Swami Swatmarama, a disciple of
Swami Goraknath.
PRODUCTION NOTES: This edition incorporates the text of
the 1914 Pancham Sinh translation and Devanagari and romanization
of the Sanskrit text.
The Sanskrit was derived from an ITRANS file from the Internet.
The versification does not match up precisely with the Sanskrit
text in the book, particularly in Chapter III.
Therefore, I've attempted to match up the ITRANS verses with
the verses in the book based on my limited reading knowledge of Sanskrit.
This embedded ITRANS converter is still experimental: this book
was essentially a pilot project for the feature.
I welcome feedback about errors in the conversion of the ITRANS Sanskrit text
to Unicode.
Note that the Firefox browser has long-standing and still uncorrected problems
displaying Unicode Devanagari, e.g. 'i' is displayed after the consonant,
instead of preceding it.
This is a known problem with Firefox and there is nothing we can do about it.--JBH
