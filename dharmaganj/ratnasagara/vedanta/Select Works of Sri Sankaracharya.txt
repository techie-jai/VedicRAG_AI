Text [Zipped]
Shankara, an Indian philosopher, probably lived in the 8th century CE.
He taught the unity of the soul and God, the 'Advaita' (non-dualistic)
branch of Vedanta Hinduism.
This is a short sampler of some of his important texts,
originally published as a Sanskrit primer with each verse
also given in Sanskrit.
This etext includes the English translation only.--J.B. Hare, December 28th, 2008.
