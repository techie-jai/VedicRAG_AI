The Ramayana in Sanskrit
This is a version of the Ramayana in Sanskrit derived from files created
by Prof. Muneo Tokunaga of Kyoto and edited by John D. Smith.
This has parallel Devanagari and Romanization.
We have not attempted to cross-reference this yet with the Griffith translation,
due to the mismatch in number of chapters per book.
