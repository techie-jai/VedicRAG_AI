The Mahabharata in Sanskrit
Parallel Devanagari and Romanization
This the Sanskrit text of the Mahabharata in Sanskrit.
This is derived from electronic files created by Prof. Muneo Tokunaga of Kyoto
and edited by John D. Smith.
Their data was used to generate parallel Devanagari and Romanization,
using custom C programs created at sacred-texts.
This text has been cross-referenced with Ganguli's
English translation on a book-by-book basis.
However, due to the mismatch in number of chapters per book, it was not
possible to cross-reference this at the chapter level.
