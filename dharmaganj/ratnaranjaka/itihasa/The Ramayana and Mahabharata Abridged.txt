Text [Zipped]
This is an abridged verse
translation of the two longest epic poems in
world literature, the Ramayana and Mahabharata.
This translation is surprisingly readable and very
moving once you get used to the rhymed couplet format.
This also serves as an ideal introduction to the sprawling plots
of these epic tales.
A complete Ramayana translation can be found here,
and a complete Mahabharata translation can be found here.
