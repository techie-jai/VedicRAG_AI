The Indian Stories of F.W. Bain
The Indian Stories of Francis William Bain (b. 1863, d. 1940) were published
early in the 20th century.
They purport to be translations of unidentified manuscripts.
However, these books are not directly
derived from Hindu texts or traditions.
Bain was eventually unveiled as a writer of orientalist fantasies, but
by that time he had a loyal readership who could care less.
He continued to press on with the series until there were thirteen volumes.
This is thus a harmless literary hoax
on a par with Bilitis.
Which is not to say that these books don't have their charm, particularly
if you like early fantasy writers, such as William Morris or Lord Dunsany.
Just don't use them as sources for information about Hindu mythology.
We are in the process of preparing etexts of all of these books.
However, there is no particular schedule for completing them.
The volumes in this series are as follows:
Vol. I : A Digit of the Moon
Vol. II: The Descent of the Sun [1903]
Vol. III: A Heifer of the Dawn [1904]
Vol. IV: In the Great God's Hair [1905]
Vol. V: A Draught of the Blue
Vol. VI: An Essence of the Dusk
Vol. VII: An Incarnation of the Snow
Vol. VIII: A Mine of Faults
Vol. IX: The Ashes of a God
Vol. X: Bubbles of the Foam
Vol. XI A Syrup of the Bees
Vol. XII: The Livery of Eve
Vol. XIII: The Substance of a Dream
