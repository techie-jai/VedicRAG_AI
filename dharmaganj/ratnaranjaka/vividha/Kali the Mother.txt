Margaret E. Noble was an Irish woman who was converted to Hinduism by the
noted Indian Guru Vivekananda during the Victorian era.

the poor of India, particularly women, in Calcutta,
providing education and medical care.
This is a short book of essays which she wrote dedicated to
the Hindu Goddess Kali.
