Studies from an Eastern Home
by Sister Nivedita(Margaret E. Noble)
[1913]
This is a set of essays by Sister Nivedita, published posthumously.
Nivedita was a woman of Irish nationality who converted to Hinduism and
spent her life selflessly helping the poor women of India.
This book gives a rare ground-level vista of vernacular Hinduism
from a woman's point of view in the 19th century.
Pervading Nivedita's writing is an earnest quest for
spiritual liberation and sincere
love for the Indian people of all castes.
Also at this site by Sister Nivedita are
Kali the Mother, and
The Web of Indian Life.
