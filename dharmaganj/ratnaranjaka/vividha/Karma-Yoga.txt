Text [Zipped]
This a set of lectures by Swami Vivekananda on the subject of Karma Yoga,
one of the several yogic paths to enlightenment.
Karma Yoga is a mental discipline which allows one to carry out one's
duties as a service to the entire world, as a path to enlightenment.
By working in the real world, but giving up attachment to work,
we can obtain spiritual liberation.
Vivekananda discusses the concept of Karma in the Bhagavada-Gita, and
singles out the Buddha as a primary example of this form of yoga.
